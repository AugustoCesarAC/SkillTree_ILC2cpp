# **Skill Tree Mod**

**Source Code**: [https://github.com/AugustoCesarAC/SkillTree](https://github.com/AugustoCesarAC/SkillTree)

## **Functions**

To open the Skill Tree Window, just press **"C"**

When a player levels up (increases Tier or Rank), they earn Skill Points:

* 1 Point for every Tier increase.
* 2 Points for every Rank increase.

*Example: If you are Tier V and advance to Tier I, you will receive 2 points.*

Skill Points are divided into three categories: **Stats, Operations, and Social.**

* **Stats**: Modify the player's base attributes, such as Max Health, XP gain, and Movement Speed.
* **Operations**: Relates to plant cultivation and Chemistry Stations.
* **Social**: Affects NPC interactions and player status.

## **Observations**

**Multiplayer:** I haven't been able to test this thoroughly in multiplayer yet. There may be bugs, and I will do my best to fix them as they are reported.

**Feedback:** If you encounter bugs, have balance suggestions, or new ideas, please notify me on the mod page.

**Open Source:** The code is open source so anyone can modify or learn from it. (I used AI to help with patching, but I manually handle the logic and code insertion when the AI struggles).

---

## **Known Issues**

(I have tried my best to fix these, but they remain minor issues for now):

* The Better Supplier interface does not update the display from 0/10 to 0/20, but you can still successfully buy 20 items.
* While the Skill Tree UI is open, you can still perform punches (but you cannot use items).
* When increasing the "Max Assigned Customers" for dealers, the UI lacks a scrollbar, but customers are assigned successfully.
* If you start the mod during the Tutorial, the Skill Tree UI will bug out.
* If you exit to the menu and restart without closing the game entirely, the mod may trigger an error.

## **Curiosity**

This isn't my first mod, but it is the first one I've made for myself that I felt was "good enough" to share. One of my previous mods, City Evolving, was actually integrated into this skill tree. My other previous work was a "Wait" system similar to Bethesda games.

---

## **F.A.Q.**

**1. Q: Why only the Mono/Alternative Branch?**
A: Built to ensure compatibility with other popular mods like Cartel Enforcer.

**2. Q: My points disappeared or my skills reset. Why?**
A: This happens if the JSON file and your save go out of sync (e.g., closing without saving). The mod safely resets skills and returns your points.
